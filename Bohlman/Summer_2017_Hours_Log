CAAO Internship Log: Summer 2017

5/17/2017: 7 hours
Today, I got introduced to what I will be doing and who I’ll be working with. I also got introduced to my work space and some of the
equipment I will be working with. I also had timesheet difficulties, so I spent a fair amount of time today trying to figure out how I can
put in my hours online (looking for future correspondence concerning online timesheet). I also picked up some equipment: monitor from Kim,
keyboard and mouse from dude on 3rd floor. The first two tasks I was given was to download the software for the Basler acA640 -750 µm
camera and figure out how to use it, and to read the book “Handbook of CCD Astronomy” cover to cover. I downloaded the software for the
camera and took a few videos/pictures with it. I also went through the first 3 chapters of the handbook and took notes on it. Tomorrow, I
want to take notes on the next two chapters of the handbook (4 and 5), and play around with the software for the camera more and start
working on a write up for that. I also want to resolve my timesheet difficulties.

Inputted hours today on UAccess. Also read/took notes through chapters 4 and 5 of the handbook. Started looking at the Basler camera
features and cataloged the different features I could find. Made notes on what program I am supposed to make and started to program in C to
reach my goals. Read the SDK guide for the Basler camera so I could program this correctly. Tomorrow, I want to finish taking notes on the
handbook and continue programming in C.

5/19/2017: 8 hours
Finished working through the handbook and taking notes. Set up Visual Studio on my laptop, along with fixing environment variables and
removing programs that could mess with my coding, and tried to import the sample projects with it. Had to download Windows SDK 8.1 to try
and build the programs. My goals for next week include starting to actually code the program I want to use with the Basler program, read
through the handbook one more time, and to start learning C++.

5/22/2017: 8 hours
Reinstalled/Modified the Visual Studio installation and got the building of the sample C++ files to work with the camera. Quickly learned
basic concepts of C++ in order to apply those concepts to my code writing. Combed through the API in order to view what exactly I have to
do in order to achieve my goals for programming. Focused exclusively on trying t find out how to edit the exposure time today; got a few
leads but nothing spectacular yet. Tomorrow, I want to make more headway on the camera exposure problem and begin planning my code writing. 
Also, I wan to change my hours log in the GitHub page to a markdown format.
